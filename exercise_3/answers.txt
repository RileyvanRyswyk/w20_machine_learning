Q1

A) The resulting form of the decision boundary of the boosted classifier is a linear combination of linear classifiers.

D) With additional iterations, the error rate trends downwards. Furthermore, the error value between iterations starts to stabilize

E) Least squares a nearly linear separation boundary unlike the simple classifier.
   Least squares also appears to be more stable in extrapolating beyond the dataset.
